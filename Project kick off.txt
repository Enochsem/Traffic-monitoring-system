What problem does this solve?

Who are you making it for?

What technologies / programming languages are you going to use?

Your planning
How are you going to divide up the work?

How are you going to plan your time?

How are you going to keep track of your progress?

How are you going to support your team mates?

What might you need to research?

What other help might you need?
